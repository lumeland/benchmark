# Jekyll

## Installation

Jekyll requires Ruby to run, which is easily managed with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). rbenv can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    $ brew install rbenv

Then change into this directory and install the required ruby:

    $ cd ssg/jekyll
    $ rbenv install

Next, make sure you have bundler installed:

    $ gem install bundler

And install the bundle:

    $ bundle install
